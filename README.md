# Object_Recognition_ML_Model_WebApp




🧠 Object Recognition Web App (CIFAR-10 | ResNet50)

📌 Overview

This project is a Deep Learning–based Web Application that performs Object Recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
It leverages a ResNet50 model architecture — a powerful convolutional neural network — to classify images into 10 object categories such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and more.

The model is integrated into a web interface, allowing users to upload an image and instantly view the predicted class and confidence score.
